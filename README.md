<h1> A new Vibrance Filter </h1>

<p> In this project we propose a new adaptive filter for images that contain faces, in order to enhance all background colors and avoid changing the skin color. Taking advantage of the fact that in the face area dominates the color of the skin, we manage with a combination of face detection and color space threshold to identify the skin areas of the image. The background colors are enhancing according to a linear transformation and at the end at the image with the enhanced colors, two different algorithms are applied, one that enhances the contrast and the other one the sharpening of the image and a comparison between them is presented. </p>
